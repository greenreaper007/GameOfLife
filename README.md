A clean implementation of the game of life in C using the MLX

to start:
  -> run make at the root of the git folder
  -> run the program from the command line with the length and height as arguments

to use:
-> Left click to draw alive cells on the grid
-> Right click to remove alive cells
-> Q to run a single tick of the simulation
-> Spacebar to run the simulation at 10 ticks per second 
(can be changed in header file to faster or slower)
-> R to reset the grid

Have fun using the program and dont hesitate to ask for features
